------- How to run erlang stuff
In then src/ directory, you can run

   $ erlc -o ebin {car,intersection,traffic}.erl
   $ erl -pa ebin/ ../lib/toml/ebin

which compiles the simulation code and puts the beam files in ebin/,
and then launches an erlang repl with the simulation and toml binaries
loaded in.  You can then call `traffic:run("roads.toml")' to start the
simulation.

To run the program without a shell, do

   $ erl -noshell -pa ebin/ ../lib/toml/ebin/ \
         -eval 'traffic:run("roads.toml")' -s init stop
